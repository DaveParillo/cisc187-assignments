# Boat inheritance
The goal of this lab is to practice working with inheritance.

This lab is adapted from the Pool Puzzle in 'Head First Java, O'Reilly Media; 2nd edition, p. 194.

Use the following code snippets and place them in the provided classes 
where there are underscores in the code.

- You may use a snippet more than once.
- You may not need all the snippets.

The goal is to make a working program that generates the following output:

```
drift  drift  hoist sail
```

Choose from the following code snippets:

```
  RowBoat            SailBoat           Boat
  subclasses         extends            return
  const              continue           break
  int                static             private
  private:           public             public:
  string             void               virtual
  override           b1                 b2
  b3                 len                len{0}
  length             int b1             int b2
  int b3             int len            int length
  drift              row row            hoist sail
  move               rowTheBoat         std::cout
```
