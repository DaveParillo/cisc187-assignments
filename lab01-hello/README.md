# cisc187-lab01-hello
Getting started with the development workflow.

Name: `your name here`

- [ ] I have compiled this project and run the unit test.

## Overview
The primary objective of this first lab is to ensure 
everyone has the ability to checkout assignments,
modify them, and submit them for grading.

## Step 1: Using Git
1. clone your cisc187 repo: `git clone <URL>`
   - Initialize your git identity:
   
   ```
   $ git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
   $ git config --global user.email janedoe@example.com
   ```
   
   You only need to do this once on each computer where you clone git repositories.
   
2. Build and run the unit test
3. Edit the [Academic integrity promise](integrity.md)

  - Fill in your name and
  - Replace the space in the square brackets with an **x** in each checkbox area `[ ]`
    - [x] if done correctly it should look like this

4. Edit this file:

  - Fill in your name in the previous section and
  - Type an **x** in the checkbox area

5. Commit your changes:

  - `git add *.md`
  - `git commit -m 'finish lab1'`
  - `git push`

## Step 2: Using Linux
1. Login to your Mesa server account
2. One the command prompt, run `setup-vim`
3. Clone your cisc187 repo again, if you didn't clone it here in Step 1
4. Build and run the unit test
5. Edit src/main.cpp on buffy using `vi`
   
   - Write a loop that prints hello world at least twice.
   - You may make other edits if you desire
   
6. Commit your changes
7. Run `vimtutor` and work through the entire tutorial

When you want to logout of the Mesa server, type `exit` at the command prompt.
